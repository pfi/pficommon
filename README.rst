- `./waf install` may fail with insufficient privileges. In doing so, it is necessary to grant necessary authority to su and sudo.
- The path of pkg-config does not pass and there is a case that .configure of a project using pficommon does not pass.
- At that time, set environment variables with "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH = $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig" (example).
- â†‘ is an example at CentOS 7. In other environments the path may be different. Specify the location of the pkgconfig directory suitable for your environment.
